Scenario 3: The Mesh of Death Adversity
=======================================

Setup and description
---------------------

You create a mesh cloud of 7 identical wireless routers near by (5m radius) like this:

.. image:: ./images/3-the-mesh-of-death-adversity.svg

*(Unlike drawn, routers will be fully connected to each other.)*

Mesh routing protocols implement algorithms to decide which path will be used to transport
payload packets. If many routers stand close by it is unlikely to get stable routing paths
and much protocol traffic will be generated in most cases. In real-life scenarios and with
bad configuration this can lead to massive problems often uncovered.

Test plan
---------

One by one turn on the wireless routers and measure the overall traffic being generated by
the respective routing protocol (**OLSR(2)**, **BMX6** and **B.A.T.M.A.N.**) within 10
minutes depending on the amount of active nodes (use default settings).

When done, describe what you did to improve the situation (e.g. adjustment of txpower).

**Requirements:**

- 7x TL-WDR4300 with OpenWRT (including olsr, olsr2, bmx6 and batman-adv)

Results and interpretation
